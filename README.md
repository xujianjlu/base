A powerful C++ base/common lib.  


#### Description

**How many times you blame**, that why you can't use C++ just like java or python ?  
**How many times you blame**, that why does C++ forces you to do everything yourself ?  
even the basic operations like 'string split', 'file operations' over and over again?

**Now, you got one !** 

This part of code is a general infrastructure base/common lib for all projects.  
It offers you the basic operations with C++, wrap the functions which you can use everywhere, free you from coding the basic modules again and again.   

#### Platform
 
For now, most source code is based on GNU/linux, and I test them OK on Ubuntu 12.04 with the compiler(gcc4.5 or later). You may have trouble on other platform like Mac os x.

#### Usage
The 'BUILD' file describe the construction options for the sources, use [Flame](https://github.com/xujianjlu/Flame) to construct this base lib.
